Thanks for checking out my Footstep Sound Pack.

# File structure

## Walking
The 'walking' folder contains single footstep sounds organized by file name. Each filename detones a surface type, a variation number and a step number.

For example, "snow_02_b" denotes snow surface, variation 2, step 2 (a, b, c etc.)

So, to use these in a game engine, I suggest creating data structures than can easily interface with this naming convention - allowing you to easily switch surface types. Though each variation has a differing amount of steps. Some have 3, some have 5 etc.

## Specials
The specials folder contains a few loopable noises imitating the sound of sliding down hills or steep terrain.

## Armor
The armor folder has step sounds for various types of armor. In a game engine, I suggest playing them simultaneously with the footsteps in a way where you can easily enable/disable the extra armor sounds or switch from chainmail to plate - or perhaps combine them both, it's up to you!

You can of course also edit the files and combine steps with armor or whatever you like.

Enjoy!

# File types

All files are in stereo wav at 44.1khz. All files are in effect mono though as footsteps generally shouldn't have a wide stereo image. The dynamics are fairly tightly controlled, I.E medium ish compression.
